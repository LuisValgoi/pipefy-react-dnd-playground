# Tooling

- `cra`: to create the project.

- `styled-components`: to style the components.

# Fonts Used

# Notes CSS

- `box-sizing: border-box;`: to not extrapolate the element's height and width.

# Notes Arquitetura

- `Create a new or keep in the same component?`: when we picture that that POC can be decoupled from the rest of the app, then we create (or, when it works separately).
